# check_scan.sh
# works as a nagios plugin to do an nmap scan of a system
# The difference between this script and what I've seen elsewhere
# is check_scan.sh provides a baseline of scan data for comparison.

# Dependencies:  nmap, nagios, linux
#
# README: (1) check the variables below in the section named
#             SET THESE VARIABLES.  Also, verify the path for
#             the GNU/Linux utilities referenced
#         (2) the other requirement is a directory that the
#             nagios user can write to.  I used /etc/nagios,
#             since the directories created there contain
#             baseline nmap scan data
#         (3) the scan files are kept in /etc/nagios/scancheck
#             in the scans directory.  The last scan is simply
#             named by the ip address of the host, such as:
#             192.168.25.3.  The baseline scan for that host
#             would be 192.168.25.3.base
#         (4) to modify the baseline and eliminate warnings
#             about ports, edit the scan file IP-address.base
#             in /etc/nagios/scancheck/scans.  Just be sure
#             that the data is a default "sort", or comparison
#             won't work.  The alternative is to simply cat
#             the last scan file to the baseline, such as:
#             cat #.#.#.# > #.#.#.#.base
#
# Installation: simply copy this script to your plugin directory,
#               make sure it is executable and has the proper
#               ownership
